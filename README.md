All templates from v2.2.0 have been generated automatically. Please downlaod the project, look for the template you are interested (in templates/ folder) and import it to your aggr.trade app

BTC & ETH popular templates:

v2.1 got popular, thus decided to keep it alive, just making sure the data feed is up to date. You'll find it as v2.1.1 in the templates/ folder

## How to Install

1. Download the [zip file](https://github.com/cryptorife/aggr-templates/archive/refs/tags/v2.1.0.zip) and Unzip it
2. Open [aggr.trade](https://aggr.trade)
3. Click "..." button on the lower right corner -> "Settings" -> "+ New" -> "Upload Template file"
4. Go to the recently unzipped folder (i.e. Downloads/aggr-templates-v2.1.0/)
5. Go to the 'templates' subdirectoy
6. Choose the template (.txt file) of your liking

BTC and ETH templates located right at the 'templates' directory are not automatically generated. The templates within 'full', 'chart' and 'tape' subdirectories are. The main difference is that BTC and ETH templates have the exchanges delta panel (shows delta activity between most popular exchanges). Generating this automatically is not possible yet, thus you won't it in the automated templates.

I hope this are useful to you!
